# Phoenix Project  

**Phoenix** is a personal security and AI assistant device designed to provide users with secure identity recognition and an intelligent, portable interface. The project combines modern AI technologies with hardware adaptability to deliver a safe and user-friendly experience.  

## 🚀 Features  

- 🔹 **Server-Based LLM**  
  Phoenix does not run its LLM (Large Language Model) on self-hardware. Instead, it connects to a secure server via the internet, ensuring stronger computational power and up-to-date AI performance.  

- 🔹 **User Recognition System**  
  The device focuses solely on recognizing the authorized user. Once identity verification is complete, all system functionalities become accessible.  

- 🔹 **Modular Microphone**  
  For privacy and security in sensitive environments, the microphone module can be detached.  

- 🔹 **PC Integration**  
  When connected to a Windows PC, Phoenix automatically launches its interface and becomes ready to use.  

- 🔹 **User-Friendly Design**  
  Simple, clear, and designed for practical daily use.  

## 🎯 Purpose  

Phoenix aims to provide engineers, students, and tech enthusiasts with a secure, customizable, and portable AI-powered solution. With its privacy-focused design and adaptability, it can be safely used in different environments.
